## About The Project

This project is part of Turing Software and Designs' Front-End Program, Module 2. The project focuses on refactoring a previously created application (with a handful of noticeable bugs and problematic functions). The program is implemented with ES6 syntax and exclusively uses array-prototype methods whenever iterations need to be performed. There are no for loops used in the program. Three databases were supplied, each representing a large chunk of data for randomly generated users, recipes, and ingredients. Our task is to create several objects containing methods which would dynamically display a given users' data on the DOM. This program also introduces these students to the use of Fetch (GETs and POSTs), Webpack, and Spies. These will be implemented to test the DOM manipulation functions (Spies), bundle files together (Webpack), and receive/change data available on the server (Fetch).

## Roadmap

The total time allotted for this project was approximately 12 days. Future features contemplated by the developers include the following:

* Tabbing through the app is functional, but we would love to see ways to improve on the accessibility.
* We would ideally like to add a feature to add items to a grocery list according to what is needed for a specific recipe. These methods are available on the Recipe class, so this would be a nice next step.
* Allowing the user to rate a recipe or offer tips/notes after confirming that they have cooked it would be a great addition to the app.
* Adding an allergen search for recipes would be great for accessibility on a whole new level.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ericberglund117/Refactor-tractor-WC-EB-KM-CD/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
