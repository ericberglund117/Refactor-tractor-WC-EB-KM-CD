<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![ScreenShot of the application recipes page][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is part of Turing Software and Design's Front-End Program, Module 2. The project focuses on refactoring a previously created application (with a handful of noticeable bugs and problematic functions). The program is implemented with ES6 syntax and exclusively uses array-prototype methods whenever iterations need to be performed. There are no for loops used in the program. Three databases were supplied, each representing a large chunk of data for randomly generated users, recipes, and ingredients. Our task is to create several objects containing methods which would dynamically display a given users' data on the DOM. This program also introduces these students to the use of Fetch (GETs and POSTs), Webpack, and Spies. These will be implemented to test the DOM manipulation functions (Spies), bundle files together (Webpack), and receive/change data available on the server (Fetch).


### Built With

* Node.js
* Mocha
* Chai
* Spies
